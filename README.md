**Observations**

**Overall Trend:**
*  Wells Fargo's stock price demonstrated a general upward trend throughout the analysis period, increasing from a starting point of around  $40 to approximately $54 within a year.

**Volatility:**
*  The stock price exhibited moderate volatility, with noticeable price fluctuations (both increases and decreases) interspersed within the broader upward trend.
*  Significant upswings occurred in mid-August 2023, mid-November 2023, and February 2024. 
*  A marked price drop was observed in late October 2023.

**SMA Analysis**
* **50-day SMA:**  At times, the 50-day SMA appeared to act as a resistance level, with the price struggling to consistently break above it, particularly in early August and late October 2023.
* **20-day SMA:** Crossovers between the 20-day SMA and the closing price potentially hinted at short-term trend changes. The 20-day SMA crossing above the closing price (like in July and December 2023) may have suggested upward momentum, while crossing below (observed in September and November 2023) possibly hinted at short-term corrections.

**Key Insights**
*  Overall, WFC displayed a primary upward movement despite periods of volatility.
*  SMAs highlighted potential areas of support/resistance and offered clues about short-term trend shifts.

**Next Steps**
